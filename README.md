# BikeShare
Explore Bikeshare data in R

For this project, we are provided with 3 csv files of bikeshare data from Washington, Chicago, and New York and the goal is to ask and answer relevant questions using these datasets by exploring them in R programming language. 

Some of the questions answered here are:

1. Which is the most common day of the wheek when the demand for bikes rises.
2. Most common hour of the day to know the busiest time in these big cities for riding bikes.
